# Contributing

I appreciate contributions in the form of issues and feedback, but as this is mainly a personal project, decisions and solutions will ultimately revolve around my own requirements (and taste).

Additionally, I won't put a guarantee on API stability; sometimes sweeping changes are necessary, and having to maintain outdated API would just hinder progress.

So, *if* you're adventurous enough to be using this software, be prepared to stay updated with the bleeding-edge branch. That said, I hope you do!
